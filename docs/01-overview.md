# 01 – Project Overview

**Wish Radio** is a social gifting and micro-crowdfunding platform built on the Bitcoin Lightning Network.

## Vision

A whimsical, interactive space where users can grant or post wishes using small Bitcoin contributions (sats). Wishes are visualized as bubbles in a 3D virtual space, growing and floating based on popularity (votes).

## Key Use Cases

- Post a wish (e.g. “I need a winter coat, $50”)
- Grant part or all of a wish using Bitcoin
- Upvote/downvote others’ wishes (costs 5 sats)
- Watch wishes float and pop as they’re granted or expire
